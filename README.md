# TheLegendOfTheMob
School finale project. A Zelda fan game where you play an octorok. 

Play the game on itch.io : https://paulineandrault.itch.io/the-legend-of-the-mob
(the cameras are slightly buggy in the browser, Windows version is better)

Highlights :
- a cool design concept with two cameras, one for the Player, one for watching Link's actions
- a fully scripted enemy (Link) who react to the player's actions, with an arborescent scenario
- an online leaderboard for each type of victory (blocking Link as fast as possible / slowing down Link the longest time possible)
